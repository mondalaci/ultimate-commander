	* gtkbasic.py (init_colors): New method which initialises colors
	used by widgets for faster creation.

	* gtkpanel.py (Panel.move_tagged_entries_squashlessly): Rename
	method name to `move_tagged_entries'. Remove `squash'
	variable. Rename variable `row_num' to `row'.
	(Panel.crowd_tagged_entries): Add new method.

	* gtkpanel.py (Panel.chdir_hook, Panel.select_row_handler):
	Replace `iso-8859-2' constant with `encoding' variable which
	now resides in `gtkconfig.py'.
	(Panel.select_row_handler): A more elegant solution used without
	catching exceptions. Remove unnecessary arguments.
	(Panel.mouse_tag_handler): Rename variable `row_num' to `row' and
	`row' to `row_iter' which results in a shorter and cleaner code.
	(Panel.set_columns_hook): Merge `Panel.new_list' and
	`Panel.resize_list' into this method. They were called only from
	here and they are short enough.
	(Panel.__init__): Align statusbar properly.
	* gtkconfig.py: Add `encoding' variable.

	* gtkpanel.py: Move "helper methods" which are formerly called as
	"user interface helpers" right after "general methods". This seems
	to be more logical, since these methods implement new features,
	instead of overdefining existing ones or gluing them together with
	the user interface.

	* basepanel.py (BasePanel.chdir_hook, BasePanel.set_columns_hook):
	Reindent correctly.

	* ChangeLog: Change log started. Finally...
